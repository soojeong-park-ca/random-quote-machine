- Git
- Mobile-first workflow
- Packages for SASS build process (concat, autoprefixer, postcss-cli, npm-run-all)

### Reflection

This is a project I built as I was practicing using React Context API and useReducer hook. Building a simple app with it made me realize how clean the components can be when the state is managed separately. It was much easier to decide what changes needed to be made to the state depending on the type of action. I'd also like to try using Redux in my next project.
